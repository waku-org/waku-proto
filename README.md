Waku v2 is a family of modular peer-to-peer protocols for secure communication. These protocols are 
designed to be secure, privacy-preserving, censorship-resistant, and able to run in resource-restricted 
environments. At a high level, Waku v2 implements a Pub/Sub messaging pattern over libp2p and adds 
capabilities to it.
